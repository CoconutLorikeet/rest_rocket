## About

`rest_rocket` is a lightweight and scalable RESTful API designed to serve as a foundation for modern web applications and microservices. Built using the powerful Rocket framework, it emphasizes performance, security, and developer experience.

## Features

‚úÖ Built on Rocket 0.5+
‚úÖ Modular architecture
‚úÖ Type-safe request and response handling
‚úÖ JSON support (via `serde`)
‚úÖ Centralized error handling
‚úÖ Easy-to-extend endpoints
‚úÖ Environment-based configuration
‚úÖ Ready for production deployment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (version 1.70+ recommended)
- `cargo` package manager (comes with Rust)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rest_rocket.git
cd rest_rocket
````

### Build the Project

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Run the Application

```bash
cargo run
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8000` by default.

## API Overview

Here‚Äôs a quick overview of the available REST endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint             | Description       |
| ------ | -------------------- | ----------------- |
| GET    | `/`                  | Welcome message   |
| GET    | `/api/v1/items`      | List all items    |
| GET    | `/api/v1/items/<id>` | Get item by ID    |
| POST   | `/api/v1/items`      | Create a new item |
| PUT    | `/api/v1/items/<id>` | Update an item    |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/items/<id>` | Delete an item    |

### Example: GET `/api/v1/items`

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/items
```

Response:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Example Item",
    "description": "This is an example."
  }
]
```

## Testing

Run all tests using:

```bash
cargo test
```

To run the app in development with auto-reloading, use:

```bash
cargo install cargo-watch
cargo watch -x run
```

## Security

* Input validation using `serde` and custom types
* Centralized error handling to avoid leaking sensitive information
* CORS support can be added easily
* TLS and authentication can be integrated if needed
